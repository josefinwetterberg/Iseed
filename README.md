# Iseed - Web Shop Admin Tool

## Overview

This project is a Laravel-based web application designed to simulate a web shop admin tool where users can manage products. The primary goal is to enhance your understanding of using a framework to build functional web applications.

## Features

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.

Filtering functionality based on category, color, price range, etc.

## Accessibility (a11y) Considerations

To ensure an inclusive and accessible user experience, the following best practices have been implemented:

Semantic HTML: Used to enhance screen reader navigation.

Form Accessibility: Properly labeled forms with clear instructions and accessible error messages.

Color Contrast: Ensured sufficient contrast between text and background.

Color Independence: Avoided relying solely on color to convey meaning (e.g., error states).

Legible Typography: Used clear, resizable fonts without breaking the layout.

## Project Management

Version Control: Managed using Git and GitHub.

Collaboration: Utilize Discord for team communication.

Development Workflow: Gitflow methodology (feature branches, pull requests, issue tracking).

Issue Tracking: Tasks are managed using GitHub Issues.
